    <h1>The Story of King the Dog</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Found at Last</h2>
    <p>King the dog, found himself caged and abandoned at the dog pound. Left behind by the people who had been taking care of him for 3 years. Confused and alone, he wondered if his master's would return to rescue him.</p>
  
    <p>"<b>Adopt of Friend, Rescue a Animal, and Share Your Love</b>" were the titles listed on "<i>Arizona Pet Adoption Website</i>" in Phoenix, AZ. King, was one of over hundred good pets who needed a home. Luckily for King, two people who had recently lost their treasured dog; Sophie, where coming that day to see King. They had picked out three wonderful dogs to see but never made it past the first, King.</p>
    <p>When the couple arrived they found King, he jumped so high his head nearly hit the ceiling of his cage. He looked as if he was in great distress. Of course, all the animals appeared to be very stressed out. The lady commented, <b><q>We have to get him out of here</q>!</b> The man agreed.<p/> 
   
    <p>King began his new life as the couple's <abbr title="Partner In Crime">PIC.</abbr> King would go on many adventures from coast to coast. Hiking, climbing, and swimming in the Great American Outdoors. He never had to <em>wonder</em> if he will be abandoned again. He is very loved and taken care of, like a <b>King.</b></p>
